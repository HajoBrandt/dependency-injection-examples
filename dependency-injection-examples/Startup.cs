            // Anywhere the AddSingleton method is used, the AddTransient or AddScoped methods can also be used. The only difference is in lifetime, from most available to least:

            // Singleton : Only ONE instance can exist for the lifetime of the Application
            // Scoped : One instance is created PER request (a request starts when an endpoint is called and dies when a result is returned)
            // Transient : One instance is created PER resolution (when it is called from the Service Container)

            // 1. Registering a Singleton (with only a single method) into the Service Container
            // This example simply demonstrates how to register Services into the Service Conttainer at the most basic level
            services.AddSingleton<ConsoleService>();

            // 2. Registering a Singleton implementing an interface into the Service Container
            // Imagine we are running on a Windows system and we implement some logic to store a file
            // If we migrate to a Linux environment we could write another StorageService class implementing the IStorageService interface for storing files on Linux
            services.AddSingleton<IStorageService, WindowsStorageService>();

            // 3. Registering a Service that needs another service into the Service Container
            // Imagine we have an EmailService that we use to send emails to customers
            // We have another service called AddressBookService that manages all the email addresses of our customers
            // The EmailService depends on the AddressBookService to send emails, we need to register both services into the Service Container
            // AddressBookService
            services.AddSingleton<IAddressBookService, AddressBookService>();
            services.AddSingleton<IEmailService, EmailService>();
        }
